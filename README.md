In this project we have evaluated 4 different categories of logs 
- Zookeeper
- Android
- Spark
- Hadoop


All these four categories of logs are being processed on two different pipelines 
- Elasticsearch 
- Spark

Below are the tables representing the comparisions of the elasticsearch and spark w.r.t to the overall runtime.
